Best-Ever Summary Sketch (for purple agent feedback)

Goal
- Provide compact, actionable signals derived from the best-ever archive (nBestGenomes)
- Map signals to parameter adjustments (mutation, crossover, popsize, selection, elitism)

Inputs (per GA run)
- best_ever_routes: list of best-ever solutions (routes), size = nBestGenomes
- best_ever_costs: fitness values for each best-ever solution
- population_stats: mean, std, diversity, convergence, best_cost, etc.

Proposed summary payload (JSON-like)
{
  "best_ever": {
    "count": 10,
    "cost_min": 145.2,
    "cost_max": 152.7,
    "cost_mean": 148.9,
    "cost_std": 2.1,
    "improvement_window": 0.7,
    "edge_overlap_ratio": 0.83,
    "route_similarity_mean": 0.78,
    "route_similarity_std": 0.09,
    "unique_edges": 124,
    "dominant_edges": ["(5,12)", "(12,9)", "(9,1)"]
  },
  "population": {
    "mean_cost": 183.9,
    "std_cost": 1.4,
    "diversity": 0.12,
    "convergence": 0.98
  }
}

Metric definitions
- improvement_window: best_ever_cost_min over last N runs vs earlier runs (trend indicator)
- edge_overlap_ratio: average fraction of shared edges between best-ever solutions
- route_similarity_mean/std: average pairwise similarity (e.g., Jaccard on edges)
- unique_edges: number of distinct edges in best-ever archive
- dominant_edges: top-K edges appearing in most best-ever routes

How the purple agent can use it (examples)
- High edge_overlap_ratio + low diversity -> increase mutation or switch to more disruptive crossover
- High cost_std + noisy convergence -> increase population_size or reduce mutation
- improvement_window near 0 -> increase exploration (mutation, popsize) or change selection
- dominant_edges stable but cost plateaus -> reduce elitism or adjust crossover type

Implementation notes (if done later)
- Extract routes for best-ever individuals from GAStatistics::bestIndividual(i)
- Compute edge lists for each route, then pairwise Jaccard similarity
- Aggregate stats after each run and include in the feedback prompt
